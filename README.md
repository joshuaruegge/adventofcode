Solutions to the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) challenges in Java, 2015-2022 (ongoing).

To provide puzzle input, place your input as a text file with the name day(num).txt in the corresponding folder in ./advent/input (for example, 2017 day 21 should look like ./advent/input/2017/day21.txt)
Alternatively, [find your session cookie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUd33_CXCzE), and place the alphanumeric value in a file named token.txt in ./advent/input for automatic downloading of input!

All work is original with the exception of a few common helper datatypes, and almost all solutions are optimized to run in under 1 second.
